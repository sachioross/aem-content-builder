# Regression Testing Article Example

The [regression test example](./regression-test.js) file was created while making an article for Medium for the Adobe Tech Blog. It demonstrates one of the potential usages and life-cycles of this tool (map components -> map pages -> build content in AEM). 

The example file requires the creation and deployment of an AEM project using the AEM Archetype with an application name of `aemcb`. It also assumes an instance available at `localhost:4502`.
